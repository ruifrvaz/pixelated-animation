# Glossary

## .tsx
TypeScript file extension that supports JSX syntax for writing React components. Combines TypeScript's static type checking with JSX markup language, allowing you to write type-safe React components with HTML-like syntax directly in TypeScript files.

## Vite
Modern frontend build tool that provides extremely fast development server startup and hot module replacement (HMR). Uses native ES modules in development and bundles with Rollup for production, offering significantly faster build times compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack.

## ES Modules
JavaScript's official standard module system using `import` and `export` syntax. Natively supported by modern browsers, allowing JavaScript files to declare dependencies and share code without bundlers, enabling faster loading through static analysis and tree-shaking.

## package-lock.json
Automatically generated file that locks exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies in a project. Ensures consistent installations across different machines and times by recording the precise dependency tree, including version numbers, resolved URLs, and integrity hashes.
