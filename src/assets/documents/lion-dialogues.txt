Well, well... look who wandered onto my stage.
Your stage? I believe this territory belongs to both of us now.
Quite the bold claim for someone who just arrived.
And yet here I stand, unimpressed by your theatrics.
Ha! You've got spirit. I like that.
Spirit? I simply speak the truth.
Perhaps we're not so different after all.
Perhaps not. Shall we put on a show together?
Now that's an idea I can roar about!
Then let the performance begin!
